  <section id="tribute-info">Vostok 1 (Russian: Восток, East or Orient 1) was the first spaceflight of the Vostok
    programme and the first human orbital spaceflight in history. The Vostok 3KA space capsule was launched from
    Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 12, 1961, with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard, making him the first human to
    reach orbital velocity around the Earth and to complete a full orbit around the Earth.

    The orbital spaceflight consisted of a single orbit around Earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at 169
    kilometers (91 nautical miles) at its lowest point. The flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing. Gagarin
    parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at 7 km (23,000 ft) altitude. <br>
    <h2>Launch</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>06:07 UTC Launch occurred from the Baikonur Cosmodrome Site No.1. Korolev radioed, "Preliminary stage.....
        intermediate..... main..... lift off! We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right." Gagarin replied,
        "Let's roll! (Poyekhali!)."[38]
        06:09 (T+ 119 s) The four strap-on boosters of the Vostok rocket used up the last of their propellant and
        dropped away from the core vehicle.</li>
      <li>06:10 (T+ 156 s) The payload shroud covering Vostok 1 was released, uncovering a window at Gagarin's feet,
        with an optical orientation device Vzor (lit. "look" or "glance").
      <li>06:12 (T+ 300 s) The rocket core stage used up its propellant and fell away from the capsule and final rocket
        stage. The final rocket stage ignited.</li>
      <li>06:13 Gagarin reported, "...the flight is continuing well. I can see the Earth. The visibility is good.... I
        almost see everything. There's a certain amount of space under cumulus cloud cover. I continue the flight,
        everything is good."
        06:14 Vostok 1 passed over central Russia. Gagarin reported, "Everything is working very well. All systems are
        working. Let's keep going!"</li>
      <li>06:15 Three minutes into the burn of the final rocket stage, Gagarin radioed, "Zarya-1, Zarya-1, I can't hear
        you very well. I feel fine. I'm in good spirits. I'm continuing the flight..." Vostok 1 started to move out of
        radio range of the Baikonur ground station.</li>
      <li>06:17 The rocket final stage shut down and Vostok 1 reached orbit. Ten seconds later the rocket separated from
        the capsule.</li>
